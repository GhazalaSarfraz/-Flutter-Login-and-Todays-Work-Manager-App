## Flutter Login and Today’s Work Manager App

A new Flutter project.
## Description:
I have developed a mobile application using Flutter that focuses on user authentication, profile management, and daily task tracking.

## Key Features:

Login and Logout with Shared Preferences:
Secure login system where the user's username and email are saved locally using Shared Preferences, allowing users to stay logged in even after closing the app.

Email Validation:
Ensured proper email format validation both during login and while displaying the profile.

Profile Page:
Displays the saved username and email with a clean, centered UI.

Tabbed Navigation:
Created a TabBar interface with two tabs:

1. Profile Viewing and Home


2. Today’s Work Management
Today’s Work Section (Using SQLite):

Add, edit, and delete your tasks.

Swipe-to-delete functionality with a confirmation dialog box.

Tasks are stored locally using SQLite Database for offline access.


## Modern UI:

Styled forms, validation error messages, and attractive buttons.

Floating action button for quick task addition.

Responsive layout for better user experience.

## Technologies Used:

Flutter (Dart)

SQLite for local database

Shared Preferences for session management

Material Design components

## What I learned:
Through this project, I strengthened my skills in state management, local data storage, Flutter UI/UX design, and mobile database handling.
